basic checking: 
docker run hello-world

Playing with Busybox:
=====================

docker pull busybox     //pull command fetches the busybox image from the Docker registry and saves it to our system
docker images          //You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system

docker run --help

docker run busybox
When you call run, the Docker client finds the image (busybox in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command 
in that container. When we run docker run busybox, we didn't provide a command, so the container booted up, 
ran an empty command and then exited.

docker ps
The docker ps command shows you all containers that are currently running.

docker ps -a  //all containers that was running earlier and now exited

docker run -it busybox  //running the conatiner in interactive mode

Clean containers once you are done with it
A]docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9  //On deletion, you should see the IDs echoed back to you.
B] docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited) //If you have a bunch of containers to delete in one go, copy-pasting IDs can be tedious. 
                                           In that case, you can simply run -
