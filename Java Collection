java.util-->Collection Framework

If Elements numbers are fixed always go for Arrays since array is fast compare to Collection.

Drawback:
•	Array can store only one type of data-type
•	Inserting and deleting elements in the middle of the array is difficult.
•	Size fixed
>No methods to process the retrieved data

Q1.	What is a collection framework?
Ans: A collection framework is a class library to handle group of objects. Collection Framework is implemented in java.util package
A collection object or an container object is an object which can store a group of other objects.

Q2.	What is a Collections?
Ans: Collections is an Class which is present inside the java.util package.
It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection.
	Java Collection class supports the polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections.
	Java Collection class throws a NullPointerException if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.

Q3.	Does collection object store copies of other objects or their references?
Ans: Collection object does not store the physical copies of other object, it simply store the references of other objects into a collection object.
